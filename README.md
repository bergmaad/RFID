# mfrc522.py
Lib file to put onto a Raspberry Pi Pico's (with or without wifi) lib folder for use with an MiFare RFID reader.

This file is written in CircuitPython and was created with ChatGPT. At the time of prompting, the ChatGPT output noted that the script was adapted from a github user cited in the comment at the top of the code. However, the original file has since been deleted from that user's profile.

# RFID.py
This code file is written in CircuitPython and utilizes the mfrc522 lib file. When the RFID is wired correctly to the Raspberry Pi Pico and the mfrc522 file is loaded onto the board's lib file, this code will print a scanned tag's 10-character UID.

This code was also created with assistance from ChatGPT.
